This is a GreaseMonkey script for translating plurks on the timeline. See

## How to install this script?

---

You will need FireFox browser and GreaseMonkey plugin. If you have them,
please proceed to step 3. Otherwise also do steps 1 and 2.

- Step 1. Download and install FireFox browser. It can be downloaded at the
  following address: http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/

- Step 2. Install GreaseMonkey FireFox addon. GreaseMonkey allows you to modify
  any page (like this one adds translation feature to Plurk's page). GreaseMonkey
  can be downloaded here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748

- Step 3. Install this script. The latest version is always at GreaseMonkey
  script repostiory:

      http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/45581.user.js

Open this link with FireFox and click "Install". Then reload your plurk page.
You will see a new "Translate" button next to each Plurk. Click it once to
translate.

If you want the responses to be translated as well, first click on the plurk
to have it opened, and then click "Translate". This will translate the plurk
and also all the responses.
